      "The word “blog,” a contraction of “web log,” is an informational w eb \n",
      "page  that consists of discrete units called “posts.”  The term “log” comes \n",
      "from the history of nautical navigation and originally referred to a \n",
      "record of chronological events kept by a ship’s crew  (Rettberg 30 ). Like \n",
      "a ship’s log, b logs on the web tend to maintain an ordered chronology, \n",

      " \n",
      " Make a point.  While posts do not require a formal thesis or claim, i t is important to have \n",

      "credible as a writer.  \n",
      " \n",
      " Create visual interest.  Consider which aspects of your content would pair well with \n",

    "1. The code begins by importing the PyPDF2 library for working with PDF files in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. It specifies the path to the PDF file that you want to extract text from and stores it in the `pdf_file_path` variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The script opens the PDF file in binary read mode using a `with` statement to ensure proper resource management.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. A `PdfReader` object is created from the opened PDF file, allowing the code to interact with the PDF's content.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. An empty string named `blog_post` is initialized. This string will be used to accumulate the extracted text from the PDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The code enters a loop to iterate through each page of the PDF. The loop runs from 0 to the total number of pages in the PDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. For each page in the loop, the code extracts text content using the `extract_text()` method and appends it to the `blog_post` string. This effectively accumulates the text from all pages in the PDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. After processing all pages, it prints the entire extracted text to the console. You can replace this step with any custom code to perform further processing or analysis of the extracted text as per your specific requirements."

    "### Code Explaination\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import necessary libraries:\n",
    "   - The code begins by importing the `nltk` library, which is the Natural Language Toolkit, and specifically, the `wordnet`, `WordNetLemmatizer`, and `word_tokenize` modules from NLTK.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Initialize the WordNet lemmatizer:\n",
    "   - The `WordNetLemmatizer` class is initialized as `lemmatizer`. WordNet is a lexical database that is used for lemmatization in NLTK.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Tokenize the input text:\n",
    "   - The code expects a variable named `blog_post` to be defined elsewhere in the script. This variable should contain the text that you want to lemmatize. The text is tokenized into words using the `word_tokenize` function, and the resulting words are stored in the `words` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Create a list to store pairs of original and lemmatized words:\n",
    "   - A list named `word_pairs` is created to store pairs of original words and their lemmatized forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Iterate through the tokenized words and perform lemmatization:\n",
    "   - A `for` loop is used to iterate through each word in the `words` list. For each word, the code does the following:\n",
    "     - It determines the part of speech (POS) of the word using `nltk.pos_tag`. This function returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a word and its corresponding POS tag. The code extracts the first element of this list, which is the POS tag, and converts it to lowercase, saving it in the `pos` variable.\n",
    "     - The code then maps the POS tags to WordNet POS tags. WordNet uses different POS tags than the Penn Treebank POS tags provided by `nltk.pos_tag`. The code maps Penn Treebank tags ('j' for adjective, 'v' for verb, 'r' for adverb) to WordNet tags ('a' for adjective, 'v' for verb, 'r' for adverb) and defaults to 'n' for nouns.\n",
    "     - The WordNet lemmatizer is used to lemmatize the word based on its POS tag, and the result is stored in the `lemma` variable.\n",
    "     - The original word and its lemmatized form are then added to the `word_pairs` list as a tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Print the word pairs:\n",
    "   - Finally, the script iterates through the `word_pairs` list and prints each original word along with its lemmatized form.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code essentially processes a text, identifies the part of speech for each word, maps the part of speech to WordNet tags, and then lemmatizes the words accordingly. The result is a list of word pairs showing the original words and their lemmatized forms."

    "1. Initialize an empty list for lemmatized words:\n",
    "   - The code creates an empty list called `lemmatized_words`, which will be used to store the lemmatized forms of words extracted from the `word_pairs` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Iterate through the `word_pairs` list:\n",
    "   - A `for` loop is used to iterate through the `word_pairs` list. In this loop, the code uses the variable `_` to ignore the original words (since they are not needed in this part of the code), and it extracts the lemmatized words and appends them to the `lemmatized_words` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Join the lemmatized words into a single string:\n",
    "   - After iterating through `word_pairs` and collecting the lemmatized words in the `lemmatized_words` list, the code uses the `join` method to concatenate these words into a single string. The `' '.join(lemmatized_words)` expression separates the words by spaces, effectively creating a string where the lemmatized words are separated by spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Print the lemmatized text:\n",
    "   - Finally, the code prints the `lemmatized_text`, which is the result of joining the lemmatized words into a single string. This string represents the original text after lemmatization, where words have been replaced with their base forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of this code will be the lemmatized version of the input text, where all the words are converted to their base forms and joined together into a single string."
