# Natural Language Processing (NLP) with Python (Beginners Level)

## Overview

This repository contains Python programs focused on **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. It covers the fundamental building blocks of NLP, introduces machine learning algorithms applicable to NLP tasks, and explores practical applications of NLP in the development of systems for human-computer interaction.

### Objectives
- Understand the basic constituents of a language.
- Learn fundamental machine learning algorithms relevant to NLP techniques.
- Demonstrate applications of NLP to develop systems that enhance human-computer interaction, such as chatbots, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), and machine translation.

### Outcomes
By working through the programs in this repository, you will be able to:
- **CO 1:** Understand the basics of NLP and its components.
- **CO 2:** Implement and demonstrate the fundamental algorithms used in NLP.
- **CO 3:** Apply NLP techniques to machine translation, chatbots, ASR systems, and other human-computer interaction systems.
- **CO 4:** Analyze linguistic structures, computational semantics, and perform semantic parsing using NLP.
