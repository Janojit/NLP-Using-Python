Each team can have a maximum of 11 players and a minimum of 7 players. There are two goalposts. The goalkeepers from each of the teams prevent the ball from entering the goal area. The other players try to zigzag their way ahead by kicking the ball. They try to pass the opponents to score a goal. It is a highly intense game with excitement, emotion, blood, and sweat.\n",
