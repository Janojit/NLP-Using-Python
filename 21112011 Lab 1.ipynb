      "Football is a game that requires strength, loads of fitness and cleverness to be played. It is a game of 90 minutes. There are two teams. Each team can have a maximum of 11 players and a minimum of 7 players. There are two goalposts. The goalkeepers from each of the teams prevent the ball from entering the goal area. The other players try to zigzag their way ahead by kicking the ball. They try to pass the opponents to score a goal. It is a highly intense game with excitement, emotion, blood, and sweat.\n",

It denoted the Sun God. The unfortunate thing was, the losing team’s captain was sacrificed to God. This element of violence and barbarism in football continued even when the early signs of modern football started emerging in England. \n",

As the player is moving forward with the ball, there is always that danger of getting the ball snatched away by the opponent.
